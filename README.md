## Objective:
To create a responsive react-app page, with the "How It Works Section included. Where the STEPs are add/removed dynamically.

## Tools & Technologies:
#### React.js, JavaScript(+ES6), CSS, VSCode, etc.

## Project Description:
There is a simple yet responsive web-page, where you could see a pre-defined list of STEPs under the section of "How It Works". Where you could add/remove the STEPs dynamically, for that you just have to click on the 'EDIT Button' and the editing options will come-up. To add a new step you have to choose a 'Icon' & write a 'Description' and click on Add. And, to remove a STEP you just have to click on the under 'red cross Icon'.

## Features:
- Responsive for all types of devices.
- Steps are add or removed dynamically.
- There are certain 'Animation' present.
- You can choose among the 7 pre-defined Icons for the new STEP.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.x.x or higher recommended)
- npm (v6.x.x or higher recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/This-is-Lakshya/How_It_Works-Section-.git
```

2. Install dependencies 
```bash
  npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
  npm start
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.


## Building for production
To create a production build, run:
